      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>Guitar players use a myriad of effects on their guitar signal in order to enhance and alter their tone to get the sound they exactly want. There is one particular style of effects that guitarists obsess over - the overdrive. The overdrive effect distorts a guitar signal in such a way that sounds - for lack of a better term - more rock’n’roll. The reason behind this obsession which becomes expensive very quickly, is that there are so many different types of overdrives out there with slightly varying sounds. This sparks heated discussions among guitarists on which overdrive is ‘the best’. </p>
      <p>Distortion works by amplifying the input gain (digitally or in analog) of a sampled waveform. When pushed beyond its intended limits, the peaks of a clean (undistorted) guitar signal will be heavily compressed: this is called “clipping”.  On a time domain, this can look like the peaks of the sampled waveform being flattened. Depending on how aggressive the clipping is (soft, hard, square-wave), this can have different implications on how the tone sounds. Notably, different overdrive circuits also exhibit different frequency responses; the famous “Tube Screamer” circuit features a boost of mid-frequencies (~700-1,000 Hz), while “transparent” overdrives like the Klon maintain a balanced frequency range. In this project, we will investigate the characteristics of each overdrive circuit’s clipping style, frequency response, and audible quality of tone to answer the question: Why do guitarists care so much? (and by extension, does it matter enough to sink hundreds or thousands of dollars into harnessing all these subtleties?<sup>[1]</sup>)
    </p>
    <p>This project aims to delve deeper into the realm of guitar signal processing by analyzing the distinct characteristics and quantitative values of different overdrive effects. By offering a more comprehensive and quantitative overview of how each effect alters the guitar signal, this analysis seeks to inform guitar players with the knowledge needed to make informed decisions about their tone.</p>
    <p>[1] No, not really. But guitarists do it anyway.
